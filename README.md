# SMOTE-BASED-CLASSIFICATION-OF-POLITICAL-SOCIAL-MEDIA-POSTS
Since the dawn of the Internet, there has been much discussion over whether and how digital  platforms such as social media influence politics. Whether sparked by political campaigns or  the general public, digital communication channels are increasingly being used to arbitrate  political and public policy issues.
Simultaneously, computer tools improve and are used to 
research political statements. During election campaigns, political candidates frequently use 
social media as an easiest way to communicate with the public. Many people believe that social 
media is an excellent platform for encouraging people to participate in politics, both online and 
off. Through a multitude of online organisations, pages, and accounts, the Internet and social 
media provide a place for young people to discuss politics. The classification of political posts 
on social media sites is aided by natural language processing and machine learning 
technologies.
